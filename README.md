# PPSC_task_7: Movie Ticket Profits
**| difficulty: 2/10 |**

You are in charge of calculating the movie theatre's profits just on its tickets. Adults are charged 25 dollars each, teens pay 15 dollars each, and children cost 5 dollars each, *unless* there are at least 2 adults present. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
You are given a list of strings, each containing how many adult, teenager, and children tickets a group needs. "|adults| |teenagers| |children|" 
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
Return the profits from each group separated by a newline. Make sure to add a newline at the end of your returned answer. This is needed to match the format for the task result.

This problem deals with if statements, lists, mapping (depends on how you solve the problem), and for loops (depends on how you solve this problem). **Do your research if you need it.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. If multiple people have the same obstacles, we would be able to go over them during the club.
